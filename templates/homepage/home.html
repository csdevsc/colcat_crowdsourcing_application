    <h3>Task Demo</h3>
    <p class="lead">Click the button below to start a sample Foci task. The demo includes the features listed below.</p>
    <button class="btn btn-lg btn-success" onclick="redirect();">Start Demo</a>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>1 - Mechanical Turk Template</h4>
      <p>The demo will start at a page designed to simulate the Amazon Mechanical Turk environment. This includes a link to the actual task on our website, a box to input the completion code, and a submit button. This tab should remain open when you start the task, so you can come back and enter your unique key.</p>

      <h4>2 - Prescreen</h4>
      <p>The prescreen task consists of 10 questions to test if the participant is actively looking at the content of the task and has basic understanding. The participant will not be able to continue to the practice/tasks until they correctly answer all questions. If they are unable to correctly answer all questions, they will be forced to either return or abandon the HIT, which does not negatively affect their Mechanical Turk statistics.</p>

      <h4>3 - Practice</h4>
      <p>The practice task allows the participant to familiarize themself with the actual task. This consists of 3 questions that are similar to the actual task. They will be the same for each foci task.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <h4>4 - Foci Task</h4>
      <p>The Foci Task randomizes the columns presented to the user. The randomization is based on a key generated from their username. They will enter their answers for the columns. There is no validation for these columns, because some cells are blank. There is a reminder to double check their answers. We can add a popup to confirm that they want to continue to the next column. They have the option of switching between the columns.</p>

      <h4>5 - Task Completion/Submission</h4>
      <p>The task completion page will contain a unique key that needs to be entered into the initial Mechanical Turk Template page. You need to change tabs to the initial page to enter your unique completion code.</p>

      <h4>6 - Backend Demo</h4>
      <p>After entering the completion code, you can review the data that you entered. This is for demonstrative purposes only. Only admins with login details to our website will be able to access this data once we go live.</p>
