<p>Dear Study Participant:</p>
<p>We are planning to develop automated programs for recognizing human hand-writing for the purposes of transcribing a large corpus of ethnolinguistic data. To develop these programs, we need to first obtain some feedback from individuals on the kinds of tasks that might be successful in developing these automated programs.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide efficient and error-free systems for converting data in hand-written form to data-addressable format that scientists can use for better understanding the content areas studies, such as the aggregation of groups of individual responses and the individual representation of concepts in language.</p>
<p>We are asking for 60 minutes of your time to complete this online study.</p>
<p>You may participate in the study more than once but you can only participate a total of three times to try out three different approaches we are testing for response collection.</p>
<p>The study involves no known risks. There are no known harms of discomforts associated with this study beyond those encountered in normal daily life. Participation in this study is voluntary. If you agree to participate via M-Turk you will have the option at the end of the study to be compensated at nominal rate of $1.50 for sixty minutes of participation. Your answers will remain confidential and you can refuse to answer any questions. However, even if you decide not to answer certain questions, please continue with the rest of the study. All collected data will be kept in an offline file in a password protected computer, and destroyed at the end of the project (or after a period of 3 years).</p>
<p>Findings from this study will help us design programs that will achieve the best transcription programs. Your participation in this project will provide valuable data to help us design programs to achieve the best possible transcriptions.</p>
<p>The University of California Irvine Institutional Review Board has approved this project (pending). If you have any questions about your rights as a participant, you may contact UCI's Office of Research Administration by phone, (949) 824-6662, by e-mail at <a href="mailto:IRB@rgs.uci.edu">IRB@rgs.uci.edu</a> or at 5171 California Avenue, Suite 150, Irvine, CA 92617. If you have any questions about this survey or about participating in the larger program, you may contact me. (telephone: 949-824-5582; email: <a href="mailto:colorcoglab@uci.edu">colorcoglab@uci.edu</a>.)</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
